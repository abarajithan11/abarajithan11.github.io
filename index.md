I am a PhD student in Kastner Research Lab @ UCSD CSE, focusing on hardware security and verification, building robust hardware/software co-designs, and accelerating AI/ML at the edge. Welcome to my personal blog, where I document my technical explorations, projects, and thoughts.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** SystemVerilog (RTL, DV, SVA), Python, C/C++, OpenCL, Bash, Tcl
* **EDA Tools:** AMD/Xilinx Vivado, Cadence Genus, Cadence Innovus, Synopsys Design Compiler
* **Verification:** Verilator, VCS, Xsim, Questa Formal, SymbiYosys, cocotb
* **Other:** Git, Docker, LaTeX, GitHub Actions

## Projects

* **[SoC Fuzzing Benchmark](/soc-fuzzing-benchmark/)**
  A standardized testbed to evaluate hardware fuzzers like Intel PreSiFuzz and RFuzz. Maps their bytestreams into AXI and test them on SoC IPs with automatically injected bugs.

* **[CGRA4ML](/cgra4ml/)**
  An open-source, automated framework for scientific edge computing. Maps DNNs from Python to custom, parameterizable SystemVerilog CGRAs with C firmware, targeting FPGAs and custom ASICs.
  
* **[FireBridge](/firebridge/)**
  A framework for system-level verification enabling rapid Firmware/Hardware co-development. Bridges SystemVerilog AXI subsystems to real C firmware via DPI-C, without simulating a CPU.

* **[SystemVerilog Course for 300 students](/systemverilog-course/)**
  64-hour short course, collaborating with Synopsys, covering RTL design, randomized transactional testbenches, AXI protocol design, FPGA & ASIC flow labs.

* **[Formal AXI Verification Stack](/formal-axi/)**
  A reusable Formal VIP for AXI4 and AXI5 protocols and for complex IPs like interconnects being built and tested against both open-source and commercial tools.

* **[AXI Stream Systolic Array](/axis-systolic-array-testbed/)**
  A lightweight, highly parameterizable systolic array in SV, integrated with Ibex-SoC via AXI DMAs, a custom DMA controller, and corresponding C firmware. Currently being formally verified.
